        <h1>Timour Basegmez</h1>
            <p>My name is Timour (in case you hadn't noticed the giant heading) and I'm an aspiring web developer- "aspiring" being the key word.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was born in Washington D.C. to foreign parents. My mother worked for the French government which led to me living in some exotic places (Nairobi to name one). Eventually I made my way back to my country of birth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I finished high school in an American school and not long after joined the Marines. Now I'm hoping to learn to code semi-proficiently so that I may fool my future employers (joking). Through this bio I hope that you will begin to know the kind of person I am and I hope you enjoy your stay on my first webpage!</p>
